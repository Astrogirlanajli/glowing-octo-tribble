Telescope Setup:

The script starts by defining parameters related to the telescope setup, such as its diameter, focal length, and the size of the CCD (charge-coupled device) sensor.
Input Image:

It loads an input image of an astronomical object (for example, an image of Jupiter taken by the Hubble Space Telescope).
Atmospheric Turbulence Simulation:

The script can simulate atmospheric turbulence effects. Atmospheric turbulence causes random fluctuations in the refractive index of air, which can distort the images formed by telescopes.
It calculates the Fried parameter, a measure of atmospheric turbulence, based on parameters like wavelength, seeing conditions, and zenith angle.
Phase screens are generated to simulate the random variations caused by atmospheric turbulence. These phase screens represent how the turbulence affects the light passing through the atmosphere.
Image Formation:

The phase screens are used to simulate the complex amplitude of the light passing through the telescope's aperture.
This complex amplitude is then Fourier transformed to obtain the Point Spread Function (PSF), which describes how a point source appears in the image. Atmospheric turbulence causes the PSF to be broader than it would be in ideal conditions.
The PSFs are convolved with the input image. This step simulates the blurring effect caused by atmospheric turbulence on the observed image.
Image Processing:

The convolved images are resampled to match the pixel size of the CCD sensor.
Interpolation is used to adjust the convolved images onto the CCD grid.
